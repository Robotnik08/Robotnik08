## Hello, my name is Sebastiaan!

I am a Dutch programmer looking to learn anything there is to learn!<br>
Programming is more then just a hobby for me, everywhere I go I get inspired, I think about code all the time. <br>
I've done a lot of things in my programming life, gradually seeking challenge, starting at Unity development I quickly learned web development and eventually low level development. <br>
I've build some serious stuff, all without ever using tutorials (tutorials suck). I am currently very proud about <a href="https://github.com/Robotnik08/Dosato.git">Dosato</a> my own (serious) programming language!<br>

<br>
You also may know me as the creator and lead developer of Slome, an indie game I've been working on for the past few years. <br>

I am currently studying web development at GLU, after this I'm looking to do a bachelor and maybe going for a master after.<br>



My talents:

1 - Programming, I know over 10 programming languages, I have build games, apps, websites, programming languages and more! Projects I'm most proud of are: <a href="https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato.git">Dosato</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Robotnik08/ChessRobot.git">Chess Robot (old)</a> <br>
2 - Fast learning, I learn incredibly fast. I quickly understand subjects and problems and learn fast.<br>
3 - I love learning new stuff, no challenge is too big for me. Giving up is not in my vocabulary<br>
